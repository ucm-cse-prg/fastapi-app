# GitHub Copilot Commit Message Generation Instructions

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for generating commit messages using GitHub Copilot.

## Instructions

1. **Write Clear and Concise Messages**: Ensure that commit messages are clear and concise, summarizing the changes made.

2. **Use Imperative Mood**: Write commit messages in the imperative mood, as if giving a command. For example, use "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".

3. **Include Relevant Details**: Provide relevant details about the changes, including the purpose and impact of the changes.

4. **Reference Issues and PRs**: If applicable, reference related issues and pull requests using the appropriate GitHub keywords (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

5. **Separate Subject and Body**: Use a blank line to separate the subject from the body of the commit message. The subject should be a brief summary, and the body can include more detailed information.

## Examples

### Good Commit Messages
- `Add user authentication feature`
- `Fix bug in payment processing`
- `Update README with installation instructions`

### Bad Commit Messages
- `Fixed stuff`
- `Update code`
- `Misc changes`

# FastAPI CRUD Application with Beanie ODM

This project is a simple CRUD application built with FastAPI, MongoDB (via Beanie and Motor), and Typer for command-line interface commands. It also offers Docker support and unit tests with pytest, making deployment and testing easy.

The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on products via a RESTful API.

## Project Overview

This sample project demonstrates:

- Asynchronous programming with FastAPI.
- Integration with MongoDB using the Beanie ODM.
- CRUD operations for product management.
- A command-line interface (via Typer) for server management.
- Containerization using Docker.
- Testing with pytest and static analysis with ruff.

## Usage

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ucm-cse-prg/fastapi-tutorial.git
   cd fastapi-tutorial
   ```

2. **Install UV:**

   [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

   For MacOS/Linux, run:

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

### Configuration

The application configuration is managed in `app/config.py` and can be customized via environment variables or a `.env` file.

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
PORT=8000
```

### MongoDB Initialization

The MongoDB connection is initialized by the asynchronous `init_mongo()` function in `app/mongo.py`. The recommended way to run MongoDB locally is using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
```

*Tip: You might need to create a custom network for proper DNS resolution in Docker setups.*

### Running the Application

Before running the application, ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your machine. You can run the server in development mode with:

```bash
uv run fastapi-app
```

For more options, use:

```bash
uv run fastapi-app --help
```

You can also specify host, port, and MongoDB URL:

```bash
uv run fastapi-app --host <HOST> --port <PORT> --mongodb-url=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

Or, for a development shortcut:

```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

## API Reference

The API endpoints (defined in `app/api.py`) include:

- **`GET /products/`** – List all products.
- **`GET /products/{product_id}`** – Retrieve a product by its ID.
- **`POST /products/`** – Create a new product.
- **`PATCH /products/{product_id}`** – Update an existing product.
- **`DELETE /products/{product_id}`** – Delete a product.

You can view the interactive Swagger UI at:  
`http://fastapi-app:8000/docs`  
(Replace `fastapi-app` and port number with your configuration if needed.)

## Development

### IDE Setup

For a better development experience, consider using VSCode with the following extensions:
- Python
- Ruff
- MyPy Type Checker
- Pylance
- Copilot/Copilot Chat
- Docker
- MongoDB for VSCode

### Run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=app
```

##### Summary of All Tests

This project includes a comprehensive test suite for the API endpoints. The tests cover:

- **Product Creation:**
    - Creating a valid product and verifying the returned data.
    - Validating input constraints by rejecting products with:
        - Prices below the minimum or above the maximum allowed.
        - Invalid names (e.g., names with spaces violating the regex).

- **Product Retrieval:**
    - Retrieving an existing product by its ID.
    - Ensuring a deleted product cannot be retrieved (expecting a 404 response).

- **Product Update:**
    - Successfully updating product details.
    - Rejecting updates with invalid data like negative prices, incorrect name formats, or prices that do not end with 0.99.
    - Handling update requests for non-existent products.

- **Product Deletion:**
    - Deleting a product and verifying it has been removed.
    - Attempting to delete non-existent products with appropriate error responses.

- **Bulk Operations:**
    - Creating multiple products in succession.
    - Retrieving all products to ensure the product list is updated correctly.

- **Error Handling:**
    - Triggering an internal server error by simulating a disconnect from the database, and verifying the system's error responses.

These tests ensure the reliability and robustness of the API in handling both valid and invalid scenarios.

### Run Ruff linting and static analysis:

```bash
uv run ruff check
```

### Run type checking with MyPy:

```bash
uv run mypy app
```

## Docker

You can build and run the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t fastapi-app .
   ```

2. **Alternatively, use Docker Compose to run both the app and MongoDB:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
